        <h2>Memories That Shaped Me</h2>
        <p>Some of my most memorable childhood experiences are rooted in simple moments—quiet observations, small responsibilities
             and lessons learned without being spoken aloud. Growing up, my family played a huge role in shaping who I am. 
             Through everyday interactions, I learned the value of patience, respect, and resilience. Watching how challenges were handled taught me to stay calm under pressure and to think before reacting.
        Certain formative moments times when I had to figure things out on my own, make mistakes or take responsibility early,helped shape my independence and problem-solving mindset. These experiences made me reflective, 
        curious and determined to improve myself. They pushed me to value growth, discipline, and consistency, qualities that continue to influence how I approach learning, relationships, and my goals today.</p>
